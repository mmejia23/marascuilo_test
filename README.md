# marascuilo_test
Following Marascuilo (1970), calculate 95% CI for each individual subject's d'.

This function uses the "one signal significance test" (Marascuilo, 1970, pp. 238-239).

I had been looking for a non-permutation way to say if a single d' (d prime) value was significantly different from zero, as to say which participants showed a sensibility different from zero. The estimated CI could be used to identify if each d' is statistically different from zero. The idea for this usage was taken from a response in a ResearchGate question: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-to-determine-whether-a-participants-d-prime-score-differs-significantly-from-what-would-be-expected-by-chance
